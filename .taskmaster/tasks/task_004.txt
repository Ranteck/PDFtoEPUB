# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Image Extraction and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract images from PDF and manage them for EPUB packaging with proper referencing and format conversion
# Details:
Create ImageExtractor class to extract images from PDF using PyMuPDF. Save images in supported EPUB formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG). Maintain aspect ratios and original quality. Create image reference mapping for XHTML embedding. Store images in OEBPS/Images directory structure. Handle image metadata and generate proper alt text when available from OCR.

# Test Strategy:
Extract images from test PDFs and verify format compatibility. Check image quality preservation and proper file naming. Validate image references match between extraction and XHTML generation.
