# Task ID: 13
# Title: Add Caching and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement caching mechanisms and performance optimizations for large PDF processing
# Details:
Implement page-level caching using hash of text + bboxes to avoid redundant LLM calls. Add disk-based cache for extracted layouts. Implement parallel processing for independent pages. Add memory management for large PDFs. Create performance monitoring and cost estimation features.

# Test Strategy:
Test caching effectiveness with documents containing duplicate pages. Measure performance improvements with parallel processing. Validate memory usage with large PDF files. Test cost estimation accuracy.
