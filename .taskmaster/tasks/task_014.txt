# Title: Create Comprehensive Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation
# Details:
Create test suite using pytest with: unit tests for each component class, integration tests for full pipeline, end-to-end tests with sample PDFs, performance benchmarks, regression tests for known issues. Include test data with various PDF types (vectorial, scanned, complex layouts). Add automated EPUB validation in tests.

# Test Strategy:
