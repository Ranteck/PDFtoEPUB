# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create XHTML Page Generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the system that converts LLM-refined layout into complete XHTML pages
# Details:
Create XHTMLGenerator class that combines LLM output with proper XHTML5 structure. Add DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements. Include CSS references, meta tags for EPUB3. Ensure each page has role='doc-pagebreak' on section element. Handle image src paths (../images/). Validate XHTML structure and fix common issues.

# Test Strategy:
Generate XHTML pages from test data and validate against XHTML5 and EPUB3 standards using validators. Test in multiple EPUB readers (Sigil, Thorium Reader). Verify image links and CSS application.
