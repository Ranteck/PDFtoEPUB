# Description: Extract fonts from PDF and embed them in EPUB with proper licensing considerations
# Details:
Create FontExtractor class using PyMuPDF to extract embedded fonts from PDF. Save fonts to OEBPS/Fonts directory. Generate @font-face CSS declarations. Handle font licensing validation and warnings. Support common font formats (TTF, OTF, WOFF). Map font names from PDF to CSS font-family declarations.
