# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement LLM Response Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Add caching mechanism for LLM responses to improve performance and reduce costs
# Details:
Create CacheManager class to cache LLM responses based on content hash. Hash text content and bbox coordinates to identify identical pages. Implement persistent cache storage using SQLite or file-based system. Add cache invalidation and cleanup mechanisms. Include cache statistics and hit rate monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Test caching with documents containing similar pages. Verify cache hits reduce LLM API calls. Check cache persistence across application restarts and validate hash collision handling.
