# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Header/Footer Cleanup System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement automatic detection and removal of repetitive headers and footers using TF-IDF analysis
# Details:
Create HeaderFooterCleaner class using TF-IDF to identify repetitive text elements across pages. Detect headers (top 10% of page) and footers (bottom 10% of page) that appear on multiple pages. Remove or mark as metadata rather than content. Handle page numbers, chapter titles, and book titles appropriately. Make cleaning configurable.

# Test Strategy:
Test with documents containing repetitive headers/footers. Verify correct identification and removal without affecting unique content. Validate that page numbers and chapter titles are handled appropriately.
