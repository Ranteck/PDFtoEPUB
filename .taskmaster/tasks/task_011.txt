# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add OCR Fallback for Scanned PDFs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement OCR processing for scanned PDFs using Docling's auto-detection capabilities
# Details:
Extend PDFExtractor to handle scanned PDFs with OCR processing. Use Docling's auto-detection to identify scanned content. Implement OCR text extraction with proper bounding box mapping. Handle mixed content (vectorial + scanned pages). Provide quality metrics for OCR accuracy and confidence scores.

# Test Strategy:
Test with scanned PDF samples. Verify OCR text extraction accuracy and proper bbox mapping. Compare processing time and quality between vectorial and scanned documents.
