# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement PDF Structure Extraction with Docling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core PDF parsing functionality using Docling's DocumentConverter to extract text, images, tables and bounding boxes
# Details:
Implement PDFExtractor class using DocumentConverter from docling. Extract layout structure with bbox coordinates, text content, images, and metadata. Handle both vectorial and scanned PDFs. Include fallback to pdfminer.six + pdfplumber if Docling fails. Export structure to JSON format with page dimensions, elements array containing type, bbox, content, and references.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample PDF files (both vectorial and scanned). Verify JSON output contains correct page count, bounding boxes are within page dimensions, and all text/images are captured. Compare extraction quality against manual inspection.
