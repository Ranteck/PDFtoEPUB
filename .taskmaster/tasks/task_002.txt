# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement PDF Structure Extraction with Docling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core PDF parsing module using Docling's DocumentConverter to extract text, images, tables and bounding boxes
# Details:
Implement PDFExtractor class using DocumentConverter from docling. Extract layout structure with bbox coordinates, text content, images, and metadata. Handle both vectorial and scanned PDFs. Include fallback to pdfminer.six + pdfplumber for edge cases. Export structure to JSON format with page dimensions, elements array containing type, bbox, content, and references.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample PDFs of different types (vectorial, scanned, complex layouts). Verify JSON output contains all required fields: page_width_pt, page_height_pt, elements with bbox coordinates, and proper image references.
